# 1. Problem Analysis

## Current Situation
Spring Boot developers typically face difficulties when:
- Setting up complex AWS infrastructure (VPC, Security Groups, Database)
- Connecting applications to Aurora Serverless MySQL
- Establishing automated CI/CD pipelines
- Managing AWS costs and resources effectively

## Key Challenges
- **Lack of Comprehensive Guidance**: Existing tutorials focus only on individual components
- **High Complexity**: AWS has many services and complex configurations
- **Security Risks**: Incorrect configurations can lead to security vulnerabilities
- **Uncontrolled Costs**: Not understanding how to optimize AWS costs

## Impact on Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Waste time learning and experimenting
- **Teams**: Delays in production deployment
- **Business**: Increased operational costs and security risks

# 2. Solution Architecture

## Architecture Overview
```
Internet → Application Load Balancer → Elastic Beanstalk → Spring Boot App
                                    ↓
                              Aurora Serverless MySQL
                                    ↓
                              VPC with Security Groups
```

## AWS Services Used
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy and manage Spring Boot applications
- **Aurora Serverless MySQL**: Serverless database with auto-scaling
- **VPC**: Virtual private cloud with public and private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Network traffic security
- **RDS Data API**: Secure database connections
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

## Security Design
- **Custom VPC**: Isolate resources in private network
- **Security Groups**: Allow only necessary traffic
- **Database in Private Subnet**: Not directly exposed to internet
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access

## Scalability
- **Auto Scaling**: Elastic Beanstalk auto-scales based on load
- **Aurora Serverless**: Database auto-scales capacity
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: High availability across availability zones
